# [WC:S Reignited] Experience Bounties System

By adding this plugin, players on your Warcraft-Source server will be eligible to collect experience bounties by killing other players that are currently on a killingspree.
After a player has killed 5 enemy players without dying they will have a 100 experience bounty put on them. For every additional kill the bounty will increase by another 25 experience, until it reaches a total of 250, which is the maximum amount of experience a boutny can yield.

All of the values mentioned are default values, and can easily be adjusted in the autogenerated configuration file.
